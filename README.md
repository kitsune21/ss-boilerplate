# ss-boilerplate
My own boilerplate for Unity Projects, with prefabs, and generic controllers already built (such as music, sound, character, etc).

# Sound Controller

# Music Controller

# UI Prefabs

## Credits Panel
Add the CreditPanel Prefab to your canvas.
Create a "Person" scriptable object, use their first name for filename.
Add the created person to the "People" list.
