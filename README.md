# ss-boilerplate
My own boilerplate for Unity Projects, with prefabs, and generic controllers already built (such as music, sound, character, etc).

# Sound Controller

# Music Controller

# UI Prefabs

## Credits Panel
1. Add the CreditPanel Prefab to your canvas.
2. Create a "Person" scriptable object, use their first name for filename.
3. Input their full name ("John Smith")
4. Select their category from the dropdown.
5. Add the created person to the "People" list.

As a note, if someone needs to be added to multiple categories, please create multiple person objects.
